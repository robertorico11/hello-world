# hello-world

Hi, I'm @robertorico11 and I'm from Queens.
I'm interested in arts & craft, drawing, and playing sports like soccer.
I'm currently learning about different ways of coding, an example is using Javascript.
I'm hoping to collaborate with my peers and finding new ideas.
You can reach me by emailing, social media, etc.
